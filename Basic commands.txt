mysql common data types:
INT                           -- Whole Numbers
DECIMAL(M,N)                  -- Decimal Numbers - Exact Value(M represents the number of all the digits, N represents the number of digits after the decimal point)
VARCHAR(l)                    -- String of text of length l
BLOB                          -- Binary Large Object, Stores large data
DATE                          -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTAMP                     -- 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' - used for recording events

when creating a table: we specify the columns:
CREATE TABLE student (
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(40),
  major VARCHAR(40)
  -- PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

tells you info about the table schema:
DESCRIBE student;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

delete table:
DROP TABLE student;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

you can edit the table schema:
ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(10,4);
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

then you can insert data and add rows:
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2, 'Kate', 'Sociology');
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(3, 'Claire');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(4, 'Jack', 'Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5, 'Mike', 'Computer Science');

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

constraints:
CREATE TABLE student (
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  -- name VARCHAR(40) UNIQUE,
  major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT 'undecided',
);

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

updating and deleting:
DELETE FROM student;

DELETE FROM student
WHERE student_id = 4;

DELETE FROM student
WHERE major = 'Sociology' AND name = 'Kate';

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Undecided';

UPDATE student
SET name = 'Johnny'
WHERE student_id = 4;

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Biological Sciences'
WHERE major = 'Biology';

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Biosociology'
WHERE major = 'Biology' OR major = 'sociology'

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Undecided', name = 'Tom'
WHERE student_id = 4;

Basic queries:
SELECT *
FROM student;

limiting:
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 2;

ordering:
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC;

SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY name, student_id DESC;

specifying:
SELECT student.name, student.major
FROM student;

filtering:
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name = 'Jack';

you can use <, >, <=, >=, =, <>(not equal), AND, OR 

SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE student_id > 2;

SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE major = 'Biology' AND student_id > 1;

in operator:
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name IN ('Tim', 'Rim');
